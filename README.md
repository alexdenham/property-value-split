# Property Value Split

This project is a simple web application that allows users to calculate how to divide the value of a house on sale based on unequal contributions. Users can input the original value of the house, the sale value, and their respective contributions to the deposit. The application will then compute the fair division of the sale proceeds.

The site is automatically deployed from the main branch using GitHub pages. To view the site, go to:

#### TODO

add validation to make sure the minimum boxes have been entered and errors if direct contributions exceed original value

Mortgage calculation, monthly interest always has to be lower than monthly payment

Update duration to allow for years and months

Add helper texts
e,g, Sale fees are any fees that will be taken directly off the sale of the property, and hence hasn't been paid by either of you. Often solicitors will take some or all of their cut directly from the sale of the property.
